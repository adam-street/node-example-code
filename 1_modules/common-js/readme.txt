What is a module?
	A module is just a bit of code encapsulated in a file, and exported to another file.
	Modules focus on a single part of functionality and remain loosely coupled with other filed in an application. 
	This is because there are no global or shared variables between modules, as they only communicate via the module.exports object.
	Any code that you want to be accessible in another file can be a module!
